Diabetes Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on classifying diabetes based on various medical features. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes or not. The dataset used for this project includes features such as pregnancy history, glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and diabetes pedigree function.

Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:

Pregnancy: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that represents the genetic risk of diabetes
Models
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for diabetes classification:

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Gaussian Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence among features.
Decision Tree: A supervised learning algorithm that splits data based on feature values to form a tree structure.
Logistic Regression: A model that computes the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function.
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models was assessed using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total predictions.

Results
The models were trained with 75% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 25%. The results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are summarized in the provided tables and visualized in graphs. The Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression models showed high accuracy and were effective in both identifying diabetic cases and minimizing false positives.
